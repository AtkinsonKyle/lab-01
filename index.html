      <h3>The Basics</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is an emerging digital capital that is exchangeable. Having a currency that is free from banks or governments, is widely accessible, yet is secure enough to store, is a promising way to provide an alternative to how we manage our monetary systems.</p>

      <h3>History of Cryptocurrency</h3>
      <p>Anonymous, electronic money was first thought of in 1983. Cryptocurrency has been updated through the years, such as "B-money" and "Bit Gold" and evolved with the innovation of the blockchain. In 2009, a person who goes by “Satoshi Nakamoto” created Bitcoin — the first decentralized digital currency with a solid and secure framework. Many cryptocurrencies have taken off since 2009, each expanding from the original framework to make an increasingly secure, digital currency.</p>

      <h3>Commonly Encountered Cryptocurrency Terms</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Hodl</dt>
        <dd> Originally a drunken, misspelling of "hold" in a forum, this is a term for early cryptocurrency adopters that are holding onto coins regardless of price volatility.</dd>
        <dt>Altcoin</dt>
        <dd>Short for alternative coin, the term is used to describe any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.</dd>
        <dt>Blockchain</dt>
        <dd>A cryptographically protected distributed ledger made up of blocks that contain transaction history. As the blockchain grows longer and longer, it becomes increasingly difficult to alter older transactions.</dd>
        <dt>Wallet</dt>
        <dd>A cryptocurrency wallet stores private and public keys, which are necessary to send and receive coins. </dd>

      <h3>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h3>
      <p>It works like a peer-to-peer exchange that takes place on a blockchain network, with a ledger recording
        transactions. The ledger ensures everyone is playing fair and eliminates the risk of double-spending.
        Cryptocurrency is decentralized and free of interventions by outside parties such as banks or other
        institutions. Digital currency is revolutionizing monetary systems and the way transactions take place for that reason.</p>
